## Benefits
- curiosity
- open source, module mentality
- ability to move from front end to back end, with one runtime

## Growing Pains
- monitoring is still a challenge
- clients expect features like java, but Node is young in enterprise
- juggling lots of things at once: AWS, CD aaaaand Node?
- ability and interest across all teams to adopt Node
- hard to find talent for full-stack engineers
- mid-tier solutions are well established in java. Need more Node boxes for same traffic.
- async, hard for backend developers to understand, but a performance boost when insight is understood

## What is a unique strength of Node?
- cultural aspects of it, using node as a catalyst for change
- two sided market place, needs an efficient tunnel, needs A/B testing, so quicker cycles with Node.js helps
- Paypal payments has many contexts on front end, backend. strong community internally, more unified
