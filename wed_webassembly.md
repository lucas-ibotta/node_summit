# WebAssembly
- Deepti Gandluri / Google

## It is:
- Efficient & fast
- Safe
- part of the Open Web platform

## It is not:
- a replacement for JS
- not a programming language
- not a plugin
- not yet a target for dynamic languages

## Native Code on the Web
- performace, portability, security
- existing native code can be compiled for the web
- challenging to use machine capabilities through JS
- browser solutions for Native code, asm.js (mozilla's approach)

## ASM.js
- subset of JS, target for compilers
- limited functionality
- inconsistent performance, not a standard

## Node & WebAssembly
- Node8 supports WebAssembly
- WebAssembly modules can be imported into Node.js apps
- on the backend, ship a single binary to any platform
- client side apps have image compression, language detection

## Use Cases
- encryption
- video editing
- server-side computation of untrusted code

## Future Features
- at MVP now
- next up is threads, exception handling, garbage collection
