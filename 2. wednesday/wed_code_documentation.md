# Beginners Mind
- Liz Howard / @lizthedeveloper / enki.com
- Bootcamp teacher, has seen the struggle
- learning new stuff sucks because *poor documentation*

## Checklist & Slides
- bit.ly/how-to-document
- slides.com/lizh/nodesummit

## Shoshin
- in the beginning, there are many possibilities
- koan
- don't orient your ideas around *your* frame of reference
- your customers are not your team, which is why they need the documentation
- learn things outside of software. get comfortable with having no idea what to do next

## Good Docs
- what a junior developer can understand gets used
- keep this mind by always learning a new skill
- teaching help. makes you better programmer


## Where do we start?
- what sort of project is this?
  - library?
  - small tool?
  - high/low distribution platform
  - PAAS

## Types of documentation
- Quickstart
  - Express has runkit, which you should use to have a playground for
- Overview
  - help us know where to go
  - high distro platforms have more first time developers, "for complete beginners"
  - choose your own adventure for many audiences
  - Lex has terrible docs because it's brand new
- API documentation
  - auto-generated API docs like Swagger or Mashery, prevents drift
  - documentation.js, with many examples for each endpoint
  - juniors build apps by copying and pasting docs
  - make docs a wiki
- Walkthroughs / Tutorials / Demos
  - step by step guides for doing a specific task
  - can turn into a personal treatise, which is *not* the goal
  - isolate examples down to the minimal possible
  - Glitch.com - community to build apps, a friendly community, ex: Alexa skill
  - write app first, then put it in Glitch, then write walkthrough
- Courses
  - useful, but there's time commitment, videos, etc
  - it's mostly about exercises and practices
  - Nodeschool.io is a great example
  - instructional (system) design. you could get a PhD in this.
  - "Engineering understanding", get some help. hire an expert (if ya can)

## Extras
- Emojis
  - markdown support, quick semantic tag for recurring themes
  - eye catching, decide upon a system like "urgent issues"
  - Consistent format across the entire org
- Tone
  - not all juniors are millennials
- Diagrams
  - folks on the specturm
- Updating docs
- Get docs translated
