# Watson and Node
- Mark Potts / Sheethal Kumar

## Innovation
- no longer making $100M projects
- it's all about rapid nimble prototyping. Node is great for that.
- Fail fast, learn fast.
- People, Tools, Process

## Watson
- cognitive abilities in applications
- 80% of the world's data is invisible
- on a scale for structured/active to unstructured/dark
- extract meaningful insights from the data
