- ployglot architecture of 20 companies, needs to be redesigned
- one task at a time UX

## Stack Challenges

- context switching between Java and front end
- difficult to share within company, UI bundles

## Goals
- more predictable
- component based development
- independent, innovative teams

## New World
- Node, npm, React, GraphQL
  - GraphQL fragments, bundled with React components
  - get a single executable schema
  - Apollo GraphQL server ?
- ? Hapi.js - plugin architecture
- inner source vs. open source
  - 75 internal NPM modules

## Dev Pipeline
- Yeoman!
