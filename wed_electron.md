# Electron Panel
- Slack, Microsoft, Github all involved
- @BiancaCreating - Biance Escalante - Github
- @kaimaetzel - MS Code Editor
- @felixrieseberg - Slack
- @0x604 - Jacob Groundwater at Github

## Slack Channel for Maintainers
- early on, collaborate and set priorities
- github issues is not enough to set bigger pictures
- growing at a rate we can handle, adding folks who know folks

## Diversity & Inclusion
- passive role for in-person meeting, was 29 men and 1 woman
- need to take an active role to reach out to folks for diversity
- running workshops, talking about social impact
- adding new people into the community helps build better products

## Two Communities
- users and maintainers
- one drives the others
- setting up recipes, norms, transparency for roadmap
- unsolicited contributions and that amount of fear for contributors
- what happens when I submit a PR and nothing happens? SLA for that community
- library is C++, so that's intimidating

## Technically strong, but with bad behavior
- alienating other contributors, making strong changes
- what do we do about that? must be addressed right away.
- establish norms for the right way to engage the community
- Slack channel / summit helps make human connections and prevent this
- "even if you're the smartest person, there's no excuse to be rude"
- code of conduct in repo

## Contributing
- reach out! no official way of saying that now. working on it.
