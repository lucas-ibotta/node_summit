## N-API
- native modules for development
- standard ABI for better and more transparent upgrades of modules
- experimental in Node8, won't be standardized until 3 years out

## HTTP2
- whole different implementation, waiting to be used

## Debugging
- five year timeline on theses
- from core dumps, adding full traces, across async contexts
- time travel debugging!
- NLP to read stack trace and say "Hey, this is associated with this change"

## Other Tools
- StackDriver tools on Google Cloud
  - passive production debugger
  - set a breakpoint with a conditional, it snapshots all variables and scope

## TC39 and node community
- browser developers and node developers, are all javascript developers
- cohesive collaboration
- top debates
  - node modules, how to switch and not drop old code on the floor
  - promises and postmortem debugging, when do we core dump? complex issue

## Exciting
- serverless, impacts on application design
- cloud computing, node should be cheaper and easier to use in cloud
- new technologies like electron
